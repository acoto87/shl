# Single Header Libraries

These are single header libraries that I use in my code, much in the style of [Sean Barret libraries](https://github.com/nothings/stb).

* list.h: A generic list implementation (see [list.md](https://github.com/acoto87/shl/blob/master/list.md)).
* stack.h: A generic stack implementation (see [stack.md](https://github.com/acoto87/shl/blob/master/stack.md)).
* queue.h: A generic queue implementation (see [queue.md](https://github.com/acoto87/shl/blob/master/queue.md)).
* map.h: A generic hash-table implementation (see [map.md](https://github.com/acoto87/shl/blob/master/map.md)).
* wave_writer.h: Contains functionality to write .wav files.

See the tests/*_tests.c files to see how to use them.

These are work in progress, and I'm using it in my games, so use at your own risk.

Any tips/suggestions are welcome.
